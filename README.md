## Font
This config is using JetBrainsMono [NerdFonts patched version](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) and thus it is mostly configured to use that.
I personally use the `ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd` package from the [AUR](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/any/ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd/).

## Backlight
It is configured to work on my system and may not work on yours. By default my user did not have write access to modify the brightness so I created a udev rule.
